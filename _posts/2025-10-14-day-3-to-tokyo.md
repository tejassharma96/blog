      After waking up early I headed to Castro's, a Cuban spot in Honolulu for "breakfast" (in quotes because I got a lunch sandwich, but it was the one that looked the most interesting!)

      Checked out of my hostel and walked half an hour to my lunch spot for the day. Had to get some more poke before leaving. While I was sitting outside the shop eating, someone drove into a parked car so I got lunch and a show!

      I walked back to my hostel, picked up my bags and headed to the airport for my flight to Tokyo. I got super lucky and didn't have anyone sitting next to me on the flight! Still wasn't able to sleep more than 30ish minutes through the ~8 hour flight though...

      I landed in Tokyo and took some very efficient trains straight to my hotel. I wish we had public transit in America...

      I headed to a close by izakaya for dinner and had various preparations of chicken (including sashimi!)

        caption: "This was something I really wanted to try while in Japan since it's really the only place you can safely eat raw chicken. It was actually really tasty! There was a bit of a mental block saying \"This is not something you should be eating raw\" but once I got past that I really enjoyed the taste and texture."
