      I woke up early to head to a fish market tour and sushi making class with my guide/chef Sato and fellow attendee Glenn (if some of the photos in this section look higher quality than the others, it's because Glenn took them. Thanks Glenn!). Learning about the market was really cool! Did you know that a whole bluefin tuna sold for over a million dollars at a tuna auction earlier this year? Also bluefin tuna pretty much always comes through Tokyo to be sold even if it wasn't fished around Tokyo. So in the summer when tuna isn't being fished in Japan but is in Boston (which apparently produces very high quality tuna), you could have a fish being shipped to Tokyo to be sold at auction and then pieces of that fish headed back to the US to be used in restaurants! Also salmon is not a traditional sushi fish due to the Pacific salmon fished around Japan having more bacteria and being less safe to eat raw - that's a newer addition from when the safer Atlantic salmon becoming available.

      After looking around the market, we headed over to Sato's to learn how to make nigiri. Mine were super messy looking but they tasted good!

    - src: /assets/images/day4/sushi/rice.jpg
      caption: "According to Sato, rice is the most important part of making sushi and the last thing that an apprentice is allowed to handle before they graduate to sushi chef. It's very important to get the texture and seasoning correct. After adding in rice vinegar seasoned with salt and sugar, it is mixed by gentling folding and cutting the rice."

      caption: "This is a traditional wasabi grinder which uses a sheet of rough sharkskin. You take the wasabi root and rub it on the sharkskin in a circular motion while holding it at an angle to grind it."
    - src: "/assets/images/day4/sushi/wasabi-ground.jpg"
      caption: "After grinding the wasabi, you brush it off the grinder with a wooden brush and put it into a small bowl."
    - src: "/assets/images/day4/sushi/knives.jpg"
      caption: "These are Sato's main knives. From top to bottom: 2 fileting knives of different sizes, a vegetable knife, an unagi knife and the sushi preparation knife"
    - src: "/assets/images/day4/sushi/slicing-fish.jpg"
      caption: "You slice the fish into pieces approximately as thick as your index and middle finger put together and as long as your index finger"
    - src: "/assets/images/day4/sushi/1-sea-bream.jpg"
      caption: "After making several cuts in the top of the fish (both for appearance, for softening the skin, and to make it easier to pull the fish around the rice), you wrap the fish around a piece of rice. \"Nigiru\" in Japanese means \"to squeeze\" and nigiri is just making a noun out of that verb, so essentially you're trying to squeeze the fish around the rice. This was my first nigiri: sea bream"

      caption: "Sardine nigiri. Nothing like what you might imagine when you think of a sardine, it was very smooth and fresh with a slight fishy flavour"
    - src: "/assets/images/day4/sushi/4-sanma.jpg"
      caption: "Sanma nigiri. This is a seasonal fish that's only available 2 months of the year so I had good timing! It was my second favourite of the day"
    - src: "/assets/images/day4/sushi/5-baby-sardine-gunkanmaki.jpg"
      caption: "Baby sardine gunkanmaki (which is when you shape the rice into a rectangle without any fish, wrap it in seaweed and then top it with a loose topping that you wouldn't be able to use for a regular nigiri). I wasn't crazy about this one - it was a bit bitter"
    - src: "/assets/images/day4/sushi/6-buri-gunkanmaki.jpg"
      caption: "Buri (aka yellowtail) gunkanmaki. This was super tender and delicious!"

      type: video
      caption: "Me making otoro (fatty bluefin tuna) nigiri! You can see me going through the steps of slicing the fish and cutting a crosshatch into the top, shaping the rice into a ball, adhering the rice to the fish with wasabi, squeezing the fish and rice together, pulling the fish around the rice, brushing with soy sauce and serving it!"

      caption: "The finished otoro nigiri. This was my favourite! It was so tender and soft, just melted in my mouth."

      After heading back to my hotel to rest for a bit, I headed out again for more food! We started with an hour-long sake tasting session where I learned about how sake is made and what the differences are between the various types of sake. After that, we headed out to various restaurants around Shinjuku and Shibuya to taste a bunch of different dishes!

        caption: "First dish up was a toro (bluefin tuna) gunkanmaki with sliced pickled radish on top! Super smooth and tender with some texture from the radish."

        caption: "An omelette filled with natto. I've tried natto before over rice and didn't like it very much due to its slimy texture, but served like this I actually really enjoyed it!"
      - src: /assets/images/day4/food-tour/hiroshima-okonomiyaki.jpg
        caption: "Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki! While the more commonly found Kansai style okonomiyaki has the cabbage mixed into the batter and the toppings pressed into that mixture, the Hiroshima style consists of 2 thin sheets of crispy batter on either side of the layered toppings (which are griddled separately) kinda similar to a grilled sandwich! Very tasty."
