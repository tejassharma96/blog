  - title: "Scallop Brunch"
    text: |
      Had an early morning (following a very early night due to how tired I was from all the flying yesterday). I decided to get brunch, and found the aptly named "Brunch Spot Waikiki" 10 minutes away from me. It was a cute little spot that quickly filled up as I ate.

      After stopping back at the hostel, I decided to head to the Honolulu Zoo. I enjoyed wondering around and looking at the various animals. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get photos of all of them due to the fences, but I did take several photos and a few videos!

      After the zoo, I took a long 30 minute stroll over to Steak Shack for a delicious lunch with a view!

  - title: "Making this website"
    text: |
      After getting back to the hostel from Steak Shack, I decided I'd try to figure out a way to share all this stuff in one place. I've had several people ask me to share photos with them, and... I can't be bothered to be sharing and annotating them everywhere so instead I spent an embarassingly long time getting this website up and running! No promises that I'll be as diligent with photos and updating the website as I have been this first 2 days though...

      I had a very delicious katsu meal at Tonkatsu Tamafuji. Click through the photos for details!

Today I went to the zoo, ate a bunch of delicious food (this will be a recurring theme) and set up this blog!
