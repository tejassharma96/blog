    text: |
      After a tiring day yesterday, today was a much later start. After getting ready I headed to Family Mart, one of Japan's "big three" convenience stores (the other 2 being 7-Eleven and Lawson's). For my "breakfast" I had some coffee, a tonkatsu sandwich and "famichiki".

      caption: "Famichiki is basically just a breaded chicken cutlet. I wanted to try it since it has something of a cult-like following online. I got the spicy famichiki and it was surprisingly actually quite spicy. Yum!"

      I headed to Don Quijote, which is a discount shopping store, since I had forgotten to bring a drawstring bag (for ease of carrying stuff around without my whole backpack). I didn't find one, but I did pick up this neat little shoulder bag and used that during the day.

      I took the train to Yokohama and spent some time wandering around.

      The reason I came to Yokohama was to come to the Ramen Museum! It had a bunch of information about the history of ramen, and more importantly several stalls where you could try slightly scaled down bowls of ramen and try a variety of different types.

      caption: "I think this was a miso tonkotsu ramen. This shop was the \"Sumire All-Stars\" shop for October, essentially rotating through a bunch of chefs who were the disciples of an old shop in Sapporo named \"Sumire Ramen\". This was really good, with a strong porky flavour (probably from all that pork fat on top)."

      caption: "This place calls its ramen \"Tonkotsu Cappucino\" due to how they extract every last bit of flavour from the pork bones and concentrate it. This was my favourite of the three I tried because of that strong taste!"

  - title: "Shinkansen back"
    text: |
      I realized google maps screwed me on the way over - there's a shinkansen (bullet train) between Tokyo and Yokohama that I could've taken! Actually, I think it was just saving me a bunch of money but I wanted to ride the fast train ðŸ˜…. I did on the way back, which made a ~50 minute journey take ~25 minutes instead!
