      Woke up at 4 am to fly out of Dallas! Arrived in Honolulu at 1:30pm local time (so ~14 hours after waking up!) after a layover in Portland and arrived at my hostel. Sharing a room with 6 other people is slightly painful (and will not be the norm for this trip - Hawaii is just expensive), but the location is worth it.

      Walked to the beach which is less than 5 minutes away, it's beautiful! Sat by the beach for a bit and then left to go to grab a spam and ume musubi. Forgot to take a pic unfortunately, it was really good though!

      Walked to a musubi store to pick up a spam and ume (sour pickled plum) musubi. Forgot to take a pic unfortunately, but it was delicious!

      Had to get poke for dinner of course! Walked to a close by poke shop and ordered a combo of two delicious types of poke. Followed it up with some Hawaiian shaved ice, which was a delicious refreshing treat (although I wasn't able to finish it). (Click into the images for captions about what specifically they are!)

      While walking home I saw a local bus and was amused to discover that their bus system is named "The Bus"

Traveling out was a slog but I'm excited for the journey ahead!
